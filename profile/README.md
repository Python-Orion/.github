**Welcome to Python Orion**, a dedicated channel for learning Python and Artificial Intelligence from scratch! [Join us on Telegram!](https://t.me/Orion_Python)

### Why Python Orion?
- In todayâ€™s fast-paced scientific advancement, programming, computer engineering, and AI are indispensable. Python serves as a fundamental tool, laying the groundwork for implementing complex concepts and everyday technologies.
- Numerous institutions, schools, and groups exist to teach Python and delve deeper into AI. You might wonder why add another channel to the list in 2024, a time when solutions like ChatGPT fulfill many everyday needs. The answer is simple:
  - **Quality and Inclusivity:** We aim to gather all types of high-quality educational content in Persian. We've noticed a lack of comprehensive Persian resources that adequately support learning or provide a proper learning curve.
  - **Conviction:** We promise that our content will convince you of the necessity and correctness of our approach.

### Why the name "Orion"?
- We chose the name **Orion**, inspired by the celestial hunter, as we hunt for new opportunities and powerful knowledge. Orion symbolizes bravery and exploration, qualities we embed in your learning journey.
